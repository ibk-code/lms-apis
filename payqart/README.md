The frontend folder structure is bootstraped from a personal folder structure creaated by me. This structure is built on create react app and use the DDD (Design driven domain) folder approach pattern.

N:B Their are chances to see folders and files not used on this project. This are test files and folders that guide users when using this project structure

To start this project, run the following command

npm start - to start
npm run build - to make a build version

Thank you :)
